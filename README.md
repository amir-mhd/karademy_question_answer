# Project's aim
A website which it's only purpose is to help programmers in thier journey. This is a website for developers to ask developers, in it's core functionality it's just a Q&A website. Oriented toward simplicity, ease of use and getting job done by fewest clicks as possible (high efficiency).

# Motivation
The main reason for building this platform is that we all know being a developer is not all sineshine and rainbow, there are so many situations which a developer needs some professional help, to get some insight, lines of code or to get grasp of a new consept. This is the place for developers to seek what they want, for all of us to spread our knowledge and give back to the community what we got at the beginning of our journey.

# Code Style
There is no specefic code style BUT, I tried to be consistent on using CBV as much as I could and trying to choose the simplest path to design the logic.

# Technology
Powerd by **Django, web framework built on Python**.
You can find the list packages used in the project in the *requirments.txt* file.

# Contribution Guide
For any contribution feel free to clone the repo. Any PL is welcome (any help on the front side of the project would be appreciated).

***hope some day, it fixs a bug***
